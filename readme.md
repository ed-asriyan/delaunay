A browser-based Delaunay triangulation generator with drag-and-drop uploading. Delaunay triangulation produces a generally recognisable low-polygon version of the original image.

Before and after:
![Example before and after image](sample.jpg "Before and after Delaunay triangulation")

##Configuration options (app/index.js): 

    EDGE_DETECT_VALUE: Lower this to increase edge contrast sensitivity
    POINT_RATE: "Number of points distribution ratio of points (number) on the edge, detail, generated higher see console" (Google Translate of "エッジ上のポイントの分布比率, 高いほど詳細, 生成されたポイント数はコンソールを参照")
    POINT_MAX_NUM: Maximum points sampled. Higher = more detail.
    BLUR_SIZE: Smaller is more detailed.
    EDGE_SIZE: Larger is more detailed.
    PIXEL_LIMIT: Images may have this many pixels at most (width x height) or will be resampled. Have had no trouble setting this to ~10,000,000 or more.
    
##Wishlist:

* Expose the configuration options in the front end, to enable more fluid experimentation.
